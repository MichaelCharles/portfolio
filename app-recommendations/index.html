<h1>Mike's App Recommendations</h1>
<p><i>These are all apps that I regularly use. I can't gaurentee that they're the best, but I can tell you that I obsessively look for better alternatives all the time, and these are the ones that I've settled on. Some of them might be obvious, but I don't really know what you know about or not know about. I didn't include apps based on popular services like Netflix, Spotify or Google Play Music.</i></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.m2" target="_blank">Skype Lite</a></strong></p>
<p>Skype is infamous for being a battery hog. Skype Lite is an official, essential features only version of the app that is super light weight.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.hangoutsdialer" target="_blank"> Hangouts and Hangouts Dialer </a></strong></p>
<p> I basically never use Hangouts, but the Hangouts Dialer lets me do free phone calls to the United States. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgollner.unclouded" target="_blank">  Unclouded </a></strong></p>
<p>Useful when you need it. It tells you which folders in your cloud drives are taking up space. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brakefield.painter" target="_blank">  Painter (Paid) </a></strong></p>
<p>Probably the best painting app for Android. Better with an S-Pen.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.chromeremotedesktop" target="_blank">  Chrome Remote Desktop </a></strong></p>
<p>You need to do more to set this up beyond simply installing the app. But once it is set up it is a really useful way to access your computer back home... Assuming you leave it on at all times.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid" target="_blank">  LastPass (Free version is fine, paid isn't worth it) </a></strong></p>
<p>You don't need to use LastPass, but you should look into using some kind of password manager. I like LastPass.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep" target="_blank">  Sleep as Android (Free is fine, paid available) </a></strong></p>
<p>This is the most popular alarm clock and sleep tracking app on Android. Lots of good features such as snooze via math, QR code or snooze by how fast your body is physically moving.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts" target="_blank">  Pocket Casts (Paid) </a></strong></p>
<p>In my opinion the best podcast app for Android. It's paid though. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.audiorecorder" target="_blank">  Sony Audio Recorder </a></strong></p>
<p>It is the best no frills free audio recorder for Android.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos.scanner" target="_blank">  Google PhotoScan </a></strong></p>
<p>Uses the camera to scan documents and photos. It automatically corrects the perspective and removes glare. This is how I took a picture of that map.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.motionstills" target="_blank">  Google Motion Stills </a></strong></p>
<p>Stabilization for short gif images.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inbox" target="_blank">  Inbox by Google </a></strong></p>
<p>Inbox is a Gmail client alternative that makes using Gmail more enjoyable on a smartphone. If you install this, uninstall Gmail or at least disable Gmail's notifications.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote" target="_blank">  Evernote (and/or Google Keep) </a></strong></p>
<p>Evernote has a paid version but it isn't necessary to use it. Evernote is complex, but once it is set up right is a powerful organizational tool for notes about things. Google Keep is kind of like a dedicated app for emails to yourself. I use them both for different things. Samsung Notes is nice, but you can't access your notes on desktop. The following link is for Evernote. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist" target="_blank">  Todoist (or TickTick) </a></strong></p>
<p>A to-do list app is super useful to me. I can get a lot done if I break things down to actionable tasks. Anyway, Todoist has a great UI on desktop and on Android. I've heard all the cool hip kids are using TickTick these days though. The link is for Todoist. Todoist also has an unnecessary premium version.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgenix.bizcal" target="_blank">  Business Calendar 2 (Free, paid premium version that allows for customization) </a></strong></p>
<p>Google's Calendar app is pretty and works really well. This app is also pretty and works well, just in different ways. It also is customizable if you pay for it. I didn't think I'd use it because I was really satisfied with Google's app, but I do.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android" target="_blank">  Pushbullet (Free, paid premium for more features) </a></strong></p>
<p>An oldie but a goodie. Pushbullet is one of the simplest ways to share content between your devices. Effortlessly share links and more to your desktop. Stop emailing yourself things. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2" target="_blank">  Solid Explorer </a></strong></p>
<p>It's a file manager. On a Samsung phone you barely need it, because Samsung's My Files app isn't awful. However Solid Explorer works a bit more like a traditional file manager. I don't remember whether or not this has a paid or free version, but it has been my file manager for years.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.thedarken.sdm" target="_blank">  SD Maid (Free, paid premium for more features) </a></strong></p>
<p>Clear unnecessary files, temporary files and leftover files from installed apps.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.briercan.embiggen" target="_blank">  Embiggen </a></strong></p>
<p>Show words really big on the screen for sending stealth messages or communicating in loud spaces.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xeus.timbre" target="_blank">  Timbre </a></strong></p>
<p>Super, super simple video and audio editor. Free. Does very simple things like trimming parts out of audio and video.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse" target="_blank">Framelapse (Free, pro version available)</a></strong></p>
<p>Timelapse videos. It is much more customization than the Samsung Camera's app.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225_01" target="_blank">PowerDirector (Free, premium version available)</a></strong></p>
<p>The closest thing you can get to Sony Vegas on Android, and this gets pretty close. Very powerful video editor.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hvt.horizon" target="_blank">Horizon Camera</a></strong></p>
<p>Always take horizontal pictures and video, no matter what the orientation of your phone is. This comes in handy from time to time. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc" target="_blank">VLC Player</a></strong></p>
<p>One of the best video players on PC, also one of the best on Android. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/zunjae/anYme" target="_blank">AnYme (Not On Play Store)</a></strong></p>
<p>This app aggregates websites like KissAnime and makes them easily accessible, launching the video files in your native Android video player app.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/releases" target="_blank">Tachiyomi (Not On Play Store)</a></strong></p>
<p>An app that aggregates free manga websites and lets you read manga for free.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.disconnectandroidfirewall" target="_blank">Disconnect Pro (Galaxy App Store, Paid)</a></strong></p>
<p>This is like adblock but for your entire phone. It is made to work specifically with Samsung devices. There are alternatives like Adhell that are free, but they take a lot of effort to set up.</p>

<p><strong>Google Camera / GCam5 (Also goes by other names, any Google Camera mod that works with your phone)</strong></p>
<p>It can be a pain to find a mod that'll work with your phone, but once you do it is a great app to have. Especially some of the panorama, portrait mode and low light features are good. I use either GCam or Samsung Camera depending on the situation. I'm honestly having trouble finding something that works for your device, but I'm sure someone will develop one soon. You have to match both your device and your processor type. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher" target="_blank">Nova Launcher and related apps such as Sesame Shortcuts</a></strong></p>
<p>Nova Launcher, I think, is the best launcher for Android. Over the past five years since I started using Nova Launcher, my curiosity for new apps has caused me to again and again try other launches, and again and again I go back to Nova Launcher. It just does everyone, and it does it with very little resource drain. </p>

<p><strong>"Kustom" Apps such as KWLP or KWGT (Free version available, but only paid versions are worth it)</strong></p>
<p>These are the most customizable widget and live wallpaper apps. They're very complex though and if you want to do anything fun you need to pay for the apps and then spend hours with them learning how to use them. They are not for everyone, but I just want you to know that they exist in case that is up your ally. You'll hear about something called "Zapper." Zapper is probably a more popular alternative to Kustom, but it is no longer updated and I think the Kustom apps might replace Zapper in popularity (if not for the horrible naming scheme).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" target="_blank">Tasker (Paid)</a></strong></p>
<p>Want your phone to mute when you are within 50 meters of your workplace? Want it to do an action every Sunday at a certain time of day? Want to make your apps communicate with each other in ways they weren't designed to do? Tasker is a super powerful app that can open the doors to a lot of features you never thought possible... but it takes a long time to learn how to use. See IFTTT for a free, easier to use alternative.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/16/get-new-pixel-2-live-wallpapers-android-device-apk-download/" target="_blank">Google Pixel's Live Wallpapers</a></strong></p>
<p>People keep making apk installers for Pixel's live wallpapers. They're awesome.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maximemazzone.aerial" target="_blank">Aerial</a></strong></p>
<p>Live wallpapers of dxrone views. It's great.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin" target="_blank">Gboard</a></strong></p>
<p>Google's keyboard is awesome. Samsung's is fine, but Google's has a lot more features and an integrated search that does things such as letting you have a "gif keyboard" in any app. It is also really useful for switching between languages.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.muzei" target="_blank">Muzei</a></strong></p>
<p>Rotating wallpapers from various sources. Plugins let you use sources like the top posts of subreddits or top Pixiv posts as your daily wallpaper.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamelounge.chrooma_2_lwp.android" target="_blank">Floats</a></strong></p>
<p>Floats automatically generates floating, material design-esque live wallpapers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kunkunsoft.packagedisabler" target="_blank">BK Package Disabler</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a package manager and Bixby button disabler.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.aboutall.android.tools.backlightmanager" target="_blank">Backlight Manager</a></strong></p>
<p>Keep your phone screen on. Ugly icon, but it works.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kidscrape.king" target="_blank">Touch Lock</a></strong></p>
<p>Disable the screen so that touching it won't change anything. Good for playing YouTube videos in your pocket if you don't have YouTube Red, or leaving Pokemon Go running in your pocket (used in conjunction with Backlight Manager). I haven't actually used this in a long time, and I think there might be a native Samsung way to do this now, but I used to use this all the time.</p>

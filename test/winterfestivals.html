    <p>Living out here in the boonies of Japan gives us access to a unique variety of cultural experiences. Particularly, every February, there&#8217;s a plethora of festivals available for you to enjoy. We&#8217;ve put together this short guide to give you a better idea about what&#8217;s out there and when things are happening. Keep in mind though, that these are just some of our favorites. <a href="http://akitajet.com/wiki/Festivals#Winter_.28December-February.29">There are many more festivals available during these winter months. </a></p>
<p><strong>Paper Balloon Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 10 in Nishiki.</i></p>

<p>The Paper Balloon festival, or <em>Kamifusen-age</em>, is a yearly event in Nishiki wherein paper lantern balloons carry the wishes of the community into the sky. Unfortunately, this festival happens on the same day as the Kariwano Tug-of-War, meaning you&#8217;ll only be able to attend one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Kariwano Tug-of-War</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 10 in Daisen.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP6eDsWSgVQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The Kariwano Tug-of-War is one of the most popular February festivals among ALTs. In this festival, the town is divided into two teams which play a giant game of tug-of-war, pulling a 10 ton, 200 meter long rope. If team one wins, people say that it will be a rich year. If team two wins, people say that the price of rice will rise.</p>
<p><strong>Namahage Sedo Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 12-14 in Oga.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLvDO_58kY8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Another favorite of ALTs is the Namahage Sedo festival. This festival is one of the best ways to experience what the Namahage Museum calls Akita&#8217;s &#8220;intangible cultural heritage&#8221;. The mountain gods, Namahage, come down the mountain bearing torches to search for disobedient and lazy children and wives.</p>
<p><strong>Akita Inukko Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 13-14 in Yuzawa.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FQ3YEkoGOg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Based in a tradition of crafting small statues of dogs, cranes, and tortoises and placing them in entrances of homes to ward off potential bandits, at the Akita Inukko Festival locals build giant statues of dogs in front of snow shrines. People see it as a way to bring protection from wrongdoing, as well as pray for a good harvest. </p>
<p><strong>Candy Market Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 13-14 in Odate.</i></p>

<p>The Candy Market festival or <i>Amekko-ichi</i> has been held in Odate for centuries. The trees are decorated with pink candies, while venders sell sweets along O-machi. According to tradition, if you eat these sweets you will not catch a cold for the rest of the winter. </p>
<p><strong>Fire Twirling Kamakura Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 13-14 in Kakunodate.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HK3knhLpyQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In the Kakunodate Fire Swinging Kamakura (<i>Hiburi Kamakura)</i> festival, participants light fire to small bales of rice straw, which they then twirl, by a string, around themselves. It is thought that the afterimage of the twirling fire looks like an igloo (<em>kamakura</em> in Japanese), thus it is called the Fire Twirling Kamakura festival.</p>
<p><strong>Bamboo Battle Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 15 in Misato Town.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV_dzbfdZAE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The Bamboo Battle festival or <em>Takeuchi-matsuri</em> is one of the most brutal festivals you will experience in Japan. The town is divided into north and south teams, who then battle it out using giant bamboo sticks surrounded by spectators in a battlefield lit by a giant bonfire.</p>
<p><strong>Kamakura Festival</strong></p>
<p><i>On February 15-16 in Yokote.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0Tk2pp-LuE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The Yokote Kamakura festival (<em>Kamakura-matsuri</em>) sees the town filled with differently styled kamakura (igloos) and snow sculptures. Inside the igloo are altars to oshizu, water gods, where sake and rice cakes are offered. People pray to the gods for clean water in the new year.</p>

<h1 id="on-reliable-news-sources">On Reliable News Sources</h1>

<p>After the election, I felt like I needed to get a better handle on where I got my news. Before the election, my primary source of news was whatever made it to the top of /r/all on Reddit, as well as anything on the /r/politics subreddit.</p>

<p>There are ways in which this wasn’t horrible, but I felt like I wanted a more consistently reliable baseline for the way that I’m informed about the world, so I started investigating news sources.</p>



<h2 id="attempt-1-google-news">Attempt 1: Google News</h2>

<p>Before the election, I had already begun experimenting with Google News (<a href="https://news.google.com/news">https://news.google.com/news</a>). However, I found it extremely lacking. It is hard to control what sources it shows you, and it tends to show you articles with click-bait titles. You can tell it to show you less of a source, but you can’t outright remove a source. It also used my search data to show me pieces it thought I wanted to see, and often spoiled TV shows and movies with its headlines, “Next episode of Dragon Ball Super: Beerus kills Bulma?! You won’t believe the recent leaks!” (by the way, not a real headline). </p>

<p>I think that it is smart to optimize your Google News if you use enough Google products that it’ll affect what you see. My android phone will sometimes show me cards with suggested news stories, and those are influenced by your Google News settings. So I recommend signing in at <a href="https://news.google.com/news">https://news.google.com/news</a>, clicking on the “Personalize” button on the top right, and adjusting your interests and sources. For an example here are how my current sources are set up: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zCLQPiA.png">http://i.imgur.com/zCLQPiA.png</a></p>

<p>I don’t, however, recommend actually using Google News to check the news due to the reasons previously mentioned.</p>



<h2 id="attempt-2-gathering-sources-and-john-green">Attempt 2: Gathering Sources and John Green</h2>

<p>After getting fed up with Google News, I then proceeded to research news sources and try to find a list of sources that were reliable and that I could check on a daily basis. I made this huge list of sources which included the Asahi Shimbun, the Mainichi, NHK, BBC, NPC, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, the Atlantic, the Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist, Foreign Affairs, and more. </p>

<p>The problem with this is that there are just too many sources.</p>

<p>Then I saw this “Questions Thursday” video by John Green (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6gEQ6Wj7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6gEQ6Wj7U</a>). I don’t actively watch the vlogbrothers, but somehow I had found myself watching it. In the video he is asked where he gets his news from and he says, “I read the Economist, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and my hometown paper the Indianapolis Star.”</p>

<p>He didn’t expand on that, but I thought about his answer, and it made a lot of sense to me. It informs him on local affairs (Indianapolis Star), gives him a balanced view on US Politics(NYT is reliable and slightly left leaning, WSJ is reliable and slightly right leaning), and gives him an overview of global politics (the Economist).</p>

<p>I feel like having a grasp on local affairs is more important than it ever has been before. Politics isn’t just about the President. There are thousands of elected offices across the nation, and being involved in and informed about your local government is essential in enacting real change. If I lived in Sebring, I would subscribe to a local Sebring newspaper (I don’t know which one, I’d have to research).</p>



<h2 id="on-paying-for-your-news">On Paying for your News</h2>

<p>One thing you’ll notice about John Green’s list is that they are all paid news sources. The benefit of paid news sources is that you can guarantee that the newspaper isn’t beholden to their advertisers. You know that their #1 priority is providing quality journalism for their readers. Paying for these sources in a way, in my opinion, is a kind of public service in that it ensures that real journalism continues to be a thing.</p>

<p>Additionally, news sources with paid subscriptions usually have nifty extras that make it worthwhile. For example, the Economist has a feature called “Economist Expresso” where it boils down the top eight stories from around the world for that day and delivers it to you in the morning to read. It’s a neat daily briefing feature. The New York Times offers something similar. </p>

<p>However… it costs money. And that isn’t fun. I’ve found that most newspapers have coupons, sales, and in general ways to get discounts such as student or education discounts. </p>

<p>I couldn’t really justify paying for a whole bunch of digital paper subscriptions, so I’ve limited myself. First it was just to the Economist. However, the Economist’s “worldwide perspective” is almost TOO worldwide. I didn’t get a lot of specific news about what was happening in Japan or the United States.</p>

<p>Last week, I tried subscribing to the New York Times for the first time, and I’m loving it. The app updates me as soon as a breaking news story comes out. My phone will buzz and in the notification area it will have the title of the news story. This sound potentially annoying, but so far it has only buzzed my phone for things which I consider to be kind of a big deal, so so far so good. </p>



<h2 id="so-whats-reliable">So What’s Reliable?</h2>

<p>This chart was shared on reddit recently: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7xHaUXf.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/7xHaUXf.jpg</a></p>

<p>I disagree with some parts of it (I feel like both Fox News and MSNBC should be lower on the chart, for example) but in general it is a good guide.</p>

<p>Anything within the three middle columns (“Skews Liberal,” “Mainstream,” and “Skews Conservative.”) is worth reading. Anything outside of that is not worth your time. Anything that is straddling the line like the Huffington Post or Fox News you should take with a grain of salt, and not trust it unless you can back it up with a source in the middle few columns. </p>



<h2 id="so-what-do-you-like">So What Do You Like?</h2>

<p>Short version: My primary news sources are the Economist, the New York Times, and the Asahi Shimbun.</p>

<p>I’m subscribed to the Economist, as mentioned before. I’m considering unsubscribing though because they are expensive and I kind of feel like their perspective is almost too broad for me. They’re a weekly magazine, which means that their focus is more on publishing high-quality content for weekly issues, rather than providing daily news. However, I haven’t unsubscribed yet because the quality is excellent.</p>

<p>I’m subscribed to the New York Times and loving it. I like the instant updates about breaking news stories. I like that there’s a lot of journalistic integrity, the articles are smartly written, and the opinion pieces do make me think. I feel like I benefit intellectually from reading it.</p>

<p>I check the Asahi Shimbun daily. This is my equivalent of reading a “local” news source. There aren’t any Akita papers that are in English. </p>

<p>I read The Atlantic from time to time. It is probably the most biased source that I read regularly, but it is still very reputable. </p>

<p>On a real slow workday, I’ll check Reuters for some stories. They tend to report things in a very factual, boring way, but what they report tends to be extremely accurate.</p>

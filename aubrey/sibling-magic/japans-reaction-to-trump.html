    <h1 id="japans-reaction-to-trump">Japan’s Reaction to Trump</h1>



    <h2 id="things-japanese-people-dont-care-about">Things Japanese People Don’t Care About</h2>

    <p>People know that Trump has said some bad things about women, but most don’t have any idea what he could potentially do concerning reproduction rights. Access to birth control in Japan is about as bad as it is in the United States, in some places even
        worse. Sexism, in general, is worse here as well. No one knows what Planned Parenthood is. While it is easier to get an abortion in Japan than it is in the United States, it isn’t socially acceptable to tell other people that you’ve had an abortion.
        </p>

    <p>No one knows about our education problems in the United States. No one in Japan knows what Creationism is, and they would have no context for understanding the damage that Betsy DeVos could do as Education Secretary. No one cares. It just isn’t on
        their radar at all.</p>

    <p>No one cares about the wall. Apparently when Trump won one of the teachers in one of the schools in Akita made a little model on her desk of a wall with a Mexican flag on one side and an American one on the other side and showed it off, thinking that
        it was funny. The ALT at that school has family with Mexican heritage and did not find it funny. The idea that Trump’s statements about Mexicans and his building of a wall might engender racism towards Mexicans and brown people in general falls
        on deaf ears here. Japanese people largely don’t understand what racism is. They think Japan is completely free of racism. They think that is it a foreign problem. They might understand that we say that the border wall is racist, but I’m sure
        a lot of them have no idea why it is racist. They’d call it racism since we call it racism, but there’s no underlying understanding there. Most Japanese people don’t know anything about statistics concerning undocumented immigrants in the United
        States, so they won’t know that the wall is largely pointless, since most illegal immigration happens due to legal immigrants overstaying their visas rather than illegally crossing the border.</p>

    <p>No one here is going to be concerned for the rights of gay people. Gay people in Japan are largely ignored rather than tolerated or approved of. People don’t care if other people are gay, but it is still legally not accepted and there are no laws
        protecting gay people from discrimination in Japan. </p>

    <p>I haven’t seen any Japanese reporting on Bannon, former editor of Brietbart, having a large role in Trump’s organization. Nor any news about the members of the State Department who stepped down (and in reality were likely fired). Nor any news about
        Bannon being placed as head of the State Department under the Secretary of State. I haven’t heard any news in Japan about Trump wanting to put into place his own intelligence agency. I haven’t heard very much about Trump calling unfavorable news
        “Fake News” except for when he was initially nominated and yelled at CNN on TV.</p>

    <p>Anything that has to do with the structuring of the executive branch, Trump’s appointments, etc is largely not covered, I think because in order to cover it properly they’d need to teach people like… how the US government even works? And that’s a
        little bit too much for a evening news show. </p>



    <h2 id="the-reaction-of-the-typical-unengaged-japanese-person">The Reaction of the Typical Unengaged Japanese Person</h2>

    <p>(Note for context: Although called the “Liberal” “Democrat” Party, the LDP party’s ideals are nothing like what we call “liberal” or “Democrat” in the United States. This is because the terms “liberal” and “conservative” are different depending on
        their context, and they can mean different things in different contexts. The LDP is closer to the Republican party in policy than it is the Democrat party, although even that comparison is very imperfect.)</p>

    <p>I think the very first thing that needs to be noted is that most Japanese people are not very politically engaged. You think it is bad in the United States? Most Japanese people don’t care. They feel like the government is going to do what it is going
        to do no matter what they want, so why bother? Politicians are greedy and just want to help themselves. They are all the same. So why care which one gets elected? It won’t affect our daily lives, right? So why bother? </p>

    <p>To a certain extent, this attitude is more merited in Japan than it is in the United States. Since World War II, the Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) has dominated politics in Japan. They have only lost their majority in the Diet (Japan’s version of Congress)
        once in 2007, and there has only ever been one prime minister who was not LDP (in 2009).</p>

    <p>This has led to a public that is just really apathetic about politics. Imagine following a sport where the same team wins every year? Eventually people would just stop caring. </p>

    <p>This also colors the way that a lot of the election news was received. When I asked Mico’s mother what she felt about Trump and Hillary, based on what she had seen on Japanese news, she basically said, “I’m sure they both have their positives and
        their negatives. They both want what is best for America. I think Trump is rude, but I’m sure not everything they say about him is true.” To be fair, this I think had a lot to do with how the election was covered too. Japanese News basically tried
        to present the positives of each candidate from the perspective of their supporters, so they said things like, “Trump says what poorer American citizens wish they could express themselves.” or “Trump doesn’t need donations, so he is free to express
        what he truly thinks, which is why people like him.” or “He’s a billionaire and has been the CEO of major companies, so he would be good for the economy of the United States.”</p>

    <p>However, after Trump was elected, people started paying more attention to the things that he actually said he wanted to do, and the way that he talked about things. The news also started reporting more on the things that he has said which had the
        potential to directly affect Japan.</p>

    <p>Still, if you asked your everyday unengaged Japanese person what they thought, they’d probably say something like, “Trump seems bad. A lot of people appear to be upset.” but they probably couldn’t tell you why he’s bad except that he’s said some rude
        or mean things. </p>

    <p>Trump is all of the bad stereotypes about Americans writ large. Many Japanese people think that Americans are blond, blue eyed, big nosed, loud narcissists who care about expressing themselves and their individuality more than caring about the feelings
        of others or helping others. They think we’re kind of dumb, but ultimately we don’t want to hurt anyone. We just don’t know any better. Trump (or at least their perception of him) fits that stereotype perfectly, so I think for a lot of Japanese
        people they see Trump as the norm, and Obama as the exception, and they feel like Trump is more of a return to a typical American. People who think this way still believe that Trump is bad, they just don’t see him as any worse than your typical
        American. I’ve heard Japanese people say (on YouTube), “Well, they like that kind of person in America, don’t they?”</p>

    <p>Your average Japanese person with foreign friends, or your average Japanese person who pays attention to English news sources, will probably have a similar opinion as you or I. A lot of the English teachers are upset and worried for the United States,
        and by proxy they are worried about what the effect will be on the rest of the world and Japan.</p>

    <p>Artists in any country tend to be more liberal than the rest of the population, so yeah, I’ve heard of some interesting art pieces popping up like the one you mentioned. </p>



    <h2 id="what-about-the-politically-engaged-japanese-person">What About the Politically Engaged Japanese Person?</h2>

    <p>Everything I’ve said so far has been focused on what your “average Japanese person” thinks. However, there are Japanese people who are more politically engaged, who follow politics in the news, and have informed opinions.</p>

    <p>Their interests and concerns, however, are mostly going to be focused on ways in which Trump’s presidency has the potential to affect Japan directly. This means the focus is mainly on Japan’s trade deals with the United States, and their military
        relationship. </p>

    <p>Japan’s economic and military success are highly dependant on their treaty with the United States, so Trump’s insistence on “America First” has gotten people very uncomfortable (<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701220018.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701220018.html</a>)</p>

    <p>The most powerful political, economic, and military forces in Asia right now are China, Russia, and the United States. How is the United States on that list? Due to a series of military treaties and economic trade deals. </p>

    <p>While we have no territories over here, we do have a substantial amount of military bases. We have a significant military presence in Japan and South Korea with 29 military bases, as well as additional bases and military personnel in Thailand, the
        Philippines, Guam, Singapore, as well as an American military presence in the north of Australia. This presence is kept largely as insurance against China and North Korea. We aren’t really worried about China like… brutally attacking anyone. But
        a lot of the benefit of having U.S. forces in these countries isn’t to actually to wage war, but rather to say, “You don’t use your military to accomplish your goals, and we won’t have to use our military to accomplish our goals, understand?”
        With North Korea, it is different. They are a hostile nation. And they have access to nuclear weapons. However, they know that if they ever actually tried to attack one of the United States’ allies, we’d demolish them in literally hours. </p>

    <p>In this way, it makes the United States a major military player in Asia. For the countries that host our military, it provides protection. No one wants to attack a country hosting United States bases because everyone knows that if they do, the United
        States will back that country in a counter attack. </p>

    <p>Of course, hosting military bases costs money. Each country has a different arrangement with the United States about how to pay for it. Japan pays more for hosting American military bases than any other American ally. They pay %70 of the cost of hosting
        the United States military in Japan. This is seen as a mutually beneficial agreement as the United States gets military clout in the region, and Japan gets military protection from the United States. </p>

    <p>So, taking that into account, you can understand why it is upsetting for Japanese people to hear that Trump has been saying that Japan is ripping off the United States and that it needs to pay more if they expect America’s support (<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701220030.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701220030.html</a>).
        Trump has said that the treaty is unfair and that Japan shouldn’t expect that we’d support them if they were attacked (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/donald-trump-savages-japan-saying-all-they-will-do-is-watch-sony/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/donald-trump-savages-japan-saying-all-they-will-do-is-watch-sony/</a>).</p>

    <p>Now, so far, the treaties are the same. Nothing has changed. But the whole military situation where is dependant on the assumption that if one of our allies is attacked, the attacking nation would have to face the might of the United States military.
        If there is any doubt that America will stand by its treaties, then that whole power structure falls apart.</p>

    <p>American allies in Asia and South-east Asia are largely banking on the idea that by allying with the United States, they are able to stand up to China (and to a lesser degree Russia). The alternative (which some nations in this region have taken)
        is to align with China or Russia. </p>

    <p>This whole situation is also mirrored economically. Free trade deals allow the United States to have economic influence in the countries with which it has deals. One of the points of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was to solidify U.S. economic
        influence in Asia by making trade deals with countries bordering the pacific ocean. China and Russia have a number of their own trade deals with nations within the region. </p>

    <p>One of the difficulties of making trade deals with Asia (aside from the political ones) is the difference in (or sometimes lack of) copyright law. Particularly in China, there is a tendency for companies to outright steal ideas from other companies,
        and then produce the same product with none of the resources expended in development and to do so for cheaper labor. One of the fears in a trade deal with China is that companies in the west would end up suffering a similar fate (to clarify, China
        never ended up joining the deal, but as far as I understand the deal was written with this problem in mind). </p>

    <p>One of the goals of the TPP was to normalize United States copyright law in Asia and South-east Asia, to make trade easier. One of the effects of the TPP would to enact United States copyright laws in all of the participating countries.</p>

    <p>Now, I personally think it is a bad thing. It would make our own laws more draconian and enforce them on other countries. The YouTube DMCA style copyright laws for intellectual properties would become the norm. Things like Comiket would become technically
        illegal due to the use of copyrighted materials. </p>

    <p>Additionally, the trade deal was written in secret and when revealed ended up being something that largely favors big corporate interests and likely would hurt individual consumers. It would allow large corporations to sue nations if they felt like
        nations made laws which cut into their profits.</p>

    <p>It also stood to potentially raise the costs of medicine in participating countries to something more similar to what the United States pays.</p>

    <p>So I don’t like the TPP personally. Here’s a breakdown by Vox about what the TPP is/was and what it would do: <a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership">http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership</a></p>

    <p>However, Trump and Republicans just don’t like free trade. I wanted to back out of the TPP, but I wanted them to do it to make a better free trade deal with US allies in Asia and South-east Asia.</p>

    <p>American Allies who were accepting the TPP largely expected to align themselves with the United States economically and leverage that weight against China and Russia. With the United States backing out of the deal, all the power of the deal goes away,
        forcing these smaller countries to either try to negotiate individuals deals to replace it, or to align themselves with China or Russia in their own large trade deals. </p>

    <p>A lot of people think that Trump’s move in backing out of the TPP has left the door wide open for China to gain more economic influence in the region: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/23/news/economy/tpp-trump-china/">http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/23/news/economy/tpp-trump-china/</a>        also: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/24/trump-kills-tpp-giving-china-its-first-big-win/?utm_term=.532f1931662f">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/24/trump-kills-tpp-giving-china-its-first-big-win/?utm_term=.532f1931662f</a></p>

    <p>But as I mentioned, a lot of the concern in Japan comes from the fact that Japan relies on the United States as an economic ally. The Abe Administration initially wanted to try to convince Trump to change his mind on the TPP (<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701230046.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701230046.html</a>)
        and now at this point is looking to make a bi-lateral trade agreement with the United States in place of the TPP (<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701270049.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701270049.html</a>). It seems
        like the Japanese government, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in particular, is trying very, very hard not to make Trump angry and to convince him to make a good trade deal with Japan.</p>

    <p>However, Trump isn’t making it easy by continually lying and saying bad things about Japan. </p>

    <p>For example, Trump recently complained that there are tariffs on imports of American cars into Japan and that the arrangement is unfair… but there are no tariffs on imports: <a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701250043.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701250043.html</a>        This is confusing and angering Japanese officials.</p>



    <h2 id="the-refugee-crisis">The Refugee Crisis</h2>

    <p>Trump’s Not-A-Muslim-Ban is an ongoing story and its hard to say how things are going so far.</p>

    <p>It has been all over the news, with a focus on the stories of people affected. I think that this is getting the attention of your average Japanese person more than the other news due to the human aspect of it. There are stories on TV about green card
        holders being denied access and families being kept apart. Japanese people see that people all over the world are outraged, but they also see that their own government is silent about it. A lot of people are unhappy about that, and wish that the
        government would speak out against Trump’s immigration ban, however, it seems unlikely as Abe is currently trying to broker a trade deal with Trump (<a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701310048.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201701310048.html</a>)
